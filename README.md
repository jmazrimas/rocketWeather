# rocketWeather
A simple AngularJS app designed to let you check the weather!

## Use:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run npm install
3. This app assumes you have node/nodemon and/or nvm install on your local machine
4. You will need API keys for weather data and google map data. Put these keys in the root of this project in a file called "keys.json". The format of that file should be as follows:
```
{
  "openweathermap": "YOUR_KEY_HERE",
  "googleMaps": "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```
5. Run node server.js
6. Navigate your browser to localhost:3000 (assuming localhost resolves to your local machine aka 127.0.0.1)
